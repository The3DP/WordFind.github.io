## WordFind

WordFind is an HTML-based word game generator.
It is simple and easy to use, and supports many applications,
from fun activities, to challenging concepts.
The objective of the game is to find all the words in the puzzle. 
It is similar to the procedures of a word search game.
NOTE: YOU are the one generating the word search game,
so you will already know the answers. This is to be 
played by those that don't generate the game.

## Using the 'Code Files':
WordFind consists of three code files:

- [Code.html](https://github.com/The3DP/WordFind.github.io/blob/main/Code%20Files/CODE.html)
- [LoftCode.html](https://github.com/The3DP/WordFind.github.io/blob/main/Code%20Files/LoftCODE.html)
- and [SummitCode.html](https://github.com/The3DP/WordFind.github.io/blob/main/Code%20Files/SummitCODE.html)

These files each contain various levels and modes of the game. Below, we 
will demonstrate how each one performs.
