WordFind is an HTML code-based game. 
The objective of the game is to find all the words in the puzzle.

## Using the 'Code Files':
WordFind consists of three code files:

- [Code.html](https://github.com/The3DP/WordFind.github.io/blob/main/Code%20Files/CODE.html)
- [LoftCode.html](https://github.com/The3DP/WordFind.github.io/blob/main/Code%20Files/LoftCODE.html)
- and [SummitCode.html](https://github.com/The3DP/WordFind.github.io/blob/main/Code%20Files/SummitCODE.html)

These files each contain various levels and modes of the game. Below, we 
will demonstrate how each one performs, and which one is right for you.
